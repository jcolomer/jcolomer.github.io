    <h2>Week 3: The biggest struggle</h2>


<br/>

<p><strong>Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else?</strong></p>

<p>Having a full-time job and being in the middle of a moving from a house to an apartment, my biggest struggle to this point has been the lack of time. I have taken several decisions to solve this:</p>

<p>1) Wake up every day at 4am to have 2 hours of study before job.</p>

<p>2) Take Fridays off to dedicate Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays to the program.</p>

<p>3) Quit my job at the end of July to be able to focus all my attention to DBC starting August 1st.</p>


<p><strong>Now, consider the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think.</strong></p>

<p>I embrace the DBC experience as a wide learning opportunity beyond the areas of web development or programming. I'm eager to free my time to focus all my attention to DBC. I have made the necessary arrangements to have full concentration on DBC starting August 1st.</p>
