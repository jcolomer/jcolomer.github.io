    <h2>Week 1: Initial impressions of DBC</h2>


<br/>
<img id="image1" src="images/crazy.jpg" width="400px" height="100%">



<p>Around 7 years ago, I came to the Bay Area interested in two main things: the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley and the craziness of San Francisco. I'm glad to say that my impression of DBC so far includes both attributes.</p>

<p>Due to a missunderstanding the synchronization of my GitHub account was delayed a few days, so it was actually on Thursday when I finally got access to the Phase 0 materials. I took Friday off and I have been running like crazy since then. I'm not sure about the quality of my first assignments, my main focus is to deliver them on time this initial week. The importance of the first impression! ;)</p>

<p>I'm excited and happy to enjoy this opportunity, and -as always- I will do my best to honor the challenge.</p>
