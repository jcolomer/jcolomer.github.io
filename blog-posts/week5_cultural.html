    <h2>Week 5 - Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>

<p>Pairing is a great learning experience and also a good way to keep yourself motivated by looking at the commitment and efforts of your peers. I have enjoyed the pairing sessions so far and I expect to enjoy the next ones even more, since I will soon be focused full-time on my DBC studies and will be less stressed by my current job and the apartment moving.</p>

<p>To give and receive feedback is a great way to understand better how you are perceived by your peers and how you perceive them. I value the feedback I receive and try to learn from it. It has been mostly very kind, and I have to admit that the fact that I understand and share the efforts of my peers makes it difficult for me to highlight negative things of their performance instead of just the positive ones.</p>
