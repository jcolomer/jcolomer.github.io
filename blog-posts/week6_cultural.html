    <h2>Week 6 - Stereotype Threat</h2>

<img id="image1" src="images/crazy.jpg" width="400px" height="100%">

<p>Anyone can find reasons to feel the "stereotype threat", because everybody has weak spots, defects, past mistakes, lots of failures and weird physical attributes. The moment we are living in society, we are facing the reaction of others to our imperfections.</p>

<p>It seems to me that "stereotype threat" is another way to call "insecurity" or "inferiority complex", and I think that the antidote for that is character building: to understand that you are always going to find obstacles in your way,  that the only way to overcome them is trying again and again with creativity and perseverance, and that character is built with the sum of little and big achievements.</p>

<p>The inferiority complex is cured when you realize that there are not superior people, but people with a similar number of defects than you that have found the formula to build character.</p>
