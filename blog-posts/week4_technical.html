    <h2>Ruby vs. JavaScript</h2>


<p>I would say that the scope of Ruby is greater than the one of Javascript.</p>

<p>Although Javascript has a lot of applications, it seems that its main focus is the front end side of things (user interaction, HTML manipulation, cookie manipulation, AJAX, etc.).</p>

<p>Ruby, on the other hand, seems more solid, versatile and powerful as a general-purpose language. But more than that, Ruby seems to have a quality I have never heard of regarding any other programming language: everywhere I go, I find software engineers excited about the "Beauty" of writing Ruby code. Just this quality makes Ruby a very attractive adventure to explore. Now put the extreme possibilities of this language when used with Rails, and you have a "killer cocktail".</p>
