    <h2>SQL Injection</h2>


<p>SQL injection is what happens when malicious users enter SQL commands into an SQL statement via web page input. These injected SQL commands can alter the resulting SQL statement and therefore compromise the security of your web application.</p>

<p>It seems that the only proven way to protect a web site from SQL injection attacks is to use SQL parameters. These are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time in a controlled manner. The SQL engine checks then each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally and not as part of the SQL to be executed.</p>
