    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>


<p>	We control all these properties through CSS.</p>

<p>	The margin clears the area around an element (outside the border). It is transparent and each side can be changed independently.</p>

<p>	The border properties specify the style and color of an element's border. You can have dotted borders, solid, and several 3D border styles.</p>
 
<p>	The padding properties define the space between the element border and the element content. It clears an area around the content (inside the border) of an element and it takes the background color of the element. Each padding side can be changed independently.</p>

<p>	We control all these properties through CSS. The main goal of margin and padding is to add space around the element, while the main goal of the border it to highlight the limits of the element.</p>

<p>	The use of the border is visually very different from using margins or padding. The difference between margin and padding is more obvious when we work with elements like table sand cells.</p>
