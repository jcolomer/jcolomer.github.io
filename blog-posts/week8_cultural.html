    <h2>Dealing with Conflicts</h2>


<br/>

<p>Human interaction seems to be based on conflict resolution. The moment you interact with others, there they are the different interests incubating one or more potential conflicts.</p>

<p>Spain, my country of origin, is a place of "hot blood". There that expression means that people are emotional. Joy, sadness, love, hate, conflicts are highly dramatized and exposed.</p>

<p>I usually find "hot blood" displays very funny in the movies, but do not consider it very practical in life. Since very early, I have trained myself in the other way around: the "cold blood" approach or the "British way" as they call it in Spain.</p>

<p>I have found that the best way of solving conflicts is to prevent them from happening using anticipation. If they take place, I reject escalation by eliminating emotional reactions from my side and by having a compassionate approach to others based in a compassionate approach to myself.</p>

<p>Conflicts are part of daily life. Approaching them with "cold blood" does not mean to avoid them or to surrender your position, but to reject emotional escalation and to keep the good manners.</p>
