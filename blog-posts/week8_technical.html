    <h2>Rails</h2>


<p>Rails is an open source web application framework written in Ruby. Its initial author was David Heinemeier Hansson.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize Convention over Configuration (the developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application), and the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.</p>

<p>Rails uses the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern to organize application programming. The model refers to a table in a database, and a Ruby file, the controller responds to external requests from the web server to the application by determining which view file to render, and the view is an erb file compiled to HTML at run-time.</p>

<p>Rails is separated into various packages: ActiveRecord, ActiveResource, ActionPack, ActiveSupport and ActionMailer. The developers can make packaged gems to extend existing packages.</p>

<p>Rails has become one of the most demanded development frameworks, used by established corporations and successful startups like: Amazon, BBC, Cisco, CNET, IBM, JP Morgan, NASA, Yahoo!, Scribd or Groupon.</p>
