    <h2>Week 4 - Software Engineers vs MBAs: Who should have the power?</h2>

<p>I've always been interested on Entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>At the time I had to choose a degree to pursue, if you wanted to be "an entrepreneur", the Business School was the way to go. At least that was it in Spain. So I got my Business degree, my MBA, and started my first small company, then the second, and then the third.</p>

<p>The more I got into Entrepreneurship, the more I understood that the real value of a company is not provided by its MBAs, but by its engineers. This seems even more obvious in the new tech companies, but it surprises me the importance that business-profile people (Sales, Marketing, Finance) still have in the ownership and strategic management of so many tech companies, where they are hiring and firing the real value-creators, the engineers.</p>

<p>The solution to this paradox does not require to hypothesize, since there is a clear pattern emerging: more and more engineers are becoming the CEOs of their companies. Now the MBAs work for them, and not the other way around.</p>
