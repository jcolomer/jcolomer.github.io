    <h2>How to ask good questions?</h2>


<br/>
<img id="image1" src="images/crazy.jpg" width="400px" height="100%">

<p>I find that the best question is the one you ask after having tried to answer it by yourself.</p>

<p>When you seriously try to find the answer to a problem or the right algorithm for a program, to postpone asking a question until you have exhausted all your attempts and sources to solve it makes you learn more and produce specific inquiries.</p>

<p>On the opposite side, "asking first" will help you finish your task earlier, but will probably decrease your learning ability.</p>
