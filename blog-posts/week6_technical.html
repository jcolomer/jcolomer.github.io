    <h2>Classes vs Modules in Ruby</h2>


<p>Classes and modules help Ruby programmers to reuse code.</p>

<p>Each class definition stores the methods and attributes that will be applied to each of its instances or objects every time we create one of them.</p>

<p>Modules cannot be instantiated, but by including a module in his code the Ruby developer adds a lot of functionality to his program. Modules can also been used when we want to have class names that can conflict with others previously created (for example, a Romantic module can help us wrapping the class Date so we can differentiate Romantic::Date.new from the built-in Date.new).</p>
