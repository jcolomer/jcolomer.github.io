    <h2>Values</h2>

<p>That's a long list of values! If I have to pick one, I choose Compassion. Since all us are full of defects and most of our talents are highly influenced by accident (call it accident, providence, random, luck, God, etc), it seems natural to appreciate Compassion as our logic reaction to the defects, mistakes and problems of others. Me, you, whoever, could have been born in that little African village that today is being massacred by the Ebola virus. And if that were the case, we would sure appreciate a compassionate hand.</p>

<p>In general, I try to live up to the values displayed on any Charles Chaplin movie.</p>

<p>Since long time ago I avoid giving my advice to others. I found that it is one of these things that just does not work.</p>

<p>Any exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC? Just think in that person that was born in the little African village that today is being massacred by the Ebola virus.</p>
