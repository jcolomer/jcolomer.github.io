<p>Years ago I was very surprised when I found out that Japanese girls cover their mouth when they laugh. Not doing it is considered unfemenine, disrespectful and rude in the traditional Japanese culture.</p>


<p>Other than gestures, it's interesting to see what make us laugh around the world. It seems like some jokes are international and some others are just for locals.</p>

<p>The "British Humour", for example, is not very popular in my country, although some Spaniards including myself can laugh to tears with scenes like this one of Mr Bean:</p>

<p>After several years of great success in Spain, El Tricicle tried to hit the American market performing in Broadway, but the U.S. audience did not find their jokes amusing and they had to cancel the show very soon.</p>

<p>It is not easy to find comedy geniuses able to make laugh everybody around the world. Among them, Chaplin is by far my favorite:</p>
